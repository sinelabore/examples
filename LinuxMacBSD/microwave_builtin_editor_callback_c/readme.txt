Example realizing a microwave oven.

There are some additional things shown in this example:
* The oven instance data struct contains additional members (callback list, microwave power setting)
  which were specified in the graphical editor tool
* The code shows how to manally realize a callback/observer feature (files *_cb.*)

The callback implementation follows the design, presented in the small e-book from Martin Schr√∂der (Embedded C programming design patterns 2023).
