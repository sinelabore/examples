This example generates python code and include a simple GUI based on tkinker.
The GUI allows to send events to the state machine and test the machine.

timer.py and radiator.py are help classes to make it possible to execute and simulate
the state machine. For demo purposes a base class and sub-class of the generated
state machine class are used.

Start the code with: python3.9 ./main.py

Python3 and thinker is required to run the code
