# Java Microwave Oven Implementation

This project was created with Apache Netbeans
You can build the project simply calling ant from within the Oven folder

- Classes in Oven/src/oven/Model are all generated by the codegen from the model file Reactor.xml. 
  If you want to modify the model call edit.sh shell script. Then regenerate the state machine from within the state diagram editor.
- Classes Radiator.java and Led.java in Oven/src/oven simulate some hardware.
- Class CustomTimer.java is a timer service providing single shot or cyclic timer function to the state machine.
- Class ReactorThread.java in Oven/src/oven executes the generated state machine in a thread. 

The communication from the Main class and the CustomTimer to the state machine is done via a message queue.

Run the application like: 'java -jar dist/Oven.jar'

By sending a buch of events the following userinteraction is simulated:
- Rotate wheel and increase the cooking time to 10s
- Then clode the door -> the cooking starts
- While cooking the time is decreased again by 1s
- While cooking the Led flashes
- After a while the door is opened
- And then closed again
- When the cooking time is zero everyting stops
